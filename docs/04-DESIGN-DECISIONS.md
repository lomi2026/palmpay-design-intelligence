## 2026-09-16 暗黑分层与文字可读性

按用户最新确认，全平台统一调整暗黑主题，并同时执行表面统一、小字阅读及网格去除建议。画布使用 #181818，主卡片 #262626，嵌套/输入/弹窗表面 #363636，悬浮及较亮表面 #404040，侧栏 #141414；信息容器使用固定色值，避免透明白色叠加产生不一致。弹窗表面从暗黑 card 改为 secondary，替代此前 card 与 popover 始终同色的约定。

标题保持 #e5e5e5，次级文字 #c4c4c4、说明 #b8b8b8、辅助文字 #b0b0b0；暗黑信息文字至少 12px，紧凑段落提升至 13px，原有 13–14px 正文保持。暗黑装饰网格移除，卡片无描边规范和控件/焦点必要边界保留。浅色颜色与字号、布局、内容模型及权限规则不因本次主题调整而变更。此条替代 2026-09-15 暗黑具体色值，以普通显示器可辨层级为验收方向，不能以 Mac 截图代替 Windows 实机观感确认。

## 2026-09-16 页面数据与图像缓存分离

替代同日整页导航策略：菜单使用客户端导航，保留文档和已加载图片；取消工作台路由骨架屏，让当前页面保留到目标内容就绪。业务数据仍重新读取，共享数量以轻量请求同步，当前菜单再次点击时主动刷新。图片私有缓存与版本文件 URL 保持，编辑表单不做无条件自动刷新。按用户要求，当前优化环境恢复为本地 API 与本地数据库。

## 2026-09-16 工作台导航优先数据新鲜度

菜单与管理分区切换必须重新请求业务数据，替代旧版通过页面缓存/预热加速的决策。侧栏和顶栏数据入口使用完整导航，同步更新共享布局内数据；业务请求 no-store，动态页面不复用旧缓存。封面图片继续独立缓存，不随业务数据刷新而禁用。保持现有统计口径与权限范围。

## 2026-09-15 深色表面去蓝偏

按用户反馈，深色主题延续低亮度分层与中性色规范，去除蓝灰偏色：画布 #141414、侧栏 #111111、主卡片 #181818、内层 #1c1c1c、输入/较亮表面 #242424。正文与辅助灰同步中性化；所有页面从共享语义变量继承。浅色白卡规范不变，信息/成功/警告/错误语义色及图表和上传图片保留。此条替代此前深色蓝灰具体色值。

## 2026-09-15 白色主卡片与筛选组件

工作台 studio-feature 与价值总览案例验证覆盖卡片使用 card 底色，浅色为白色，深色跟随主题。目录、贡献、搜索及项目维度筛选统一浅色白底，视图/筛选已选项保留高亮，表单编辑字段不受筛选样式影响。

## 2026-09-15 无描边卡片

首页与工作台卡片统一去掉外框描边及装饰性 ring/阴影，包括内容列表、指标、表单容器和嵌套卡片。嵌套卡片使用 secondary 底色区分层级；输入框、按钮、焦点、选中状态及上传拖放区保留功能边界。

## 2026-09-15 统一语义颜色来源

保留 A 方案现有浅色中性灰、深色蓝灰，以 shadcn 语义变量作为唯一配色来源。旧 --v9-* 仅作兼容别名；共享工作台样式和首页基础文字、背景、边框直接使用语义颜色。card 与 popover 共用卡片表面，次级表面使用 secondary，说明文字保留必要层级扩展。焦点使用 ring，普通选中使用 accent，成功/警告/信息等状态作为集中管理的扩展，destructive 与错误文字同源。保留 B 布局和现有业务功能。

## 2026-09-15 工作台恢复 A 配色

按用户确认，首页和工作台共用原方案 A 的中性灰浅色与蓝灰深色变量。保留 B 工作台布局、圆角、间距与功能，移除 B 专用灰紫底色和青柠主操作色；主题选择共用 ppux-theme，默认深色，跨首页和工作台保持一致。本条替代 2026-09-14 的独立主题偏好决定。

## 2026-09-14 当前视觉版本（替代旧 A/B 部署选择）

用户决定将方案 A 的老首页与方案 B 的工作台合为一个应用。公开首页使用 V9Home，所有 /workspace 页面使用 Studio 工作台。进入与返回均使用同源路径，主题偏好按首页与工作台分别保存，客户端跳转及直接刷新均正确切换。无需 DESIGN_VARIANT 环境变量。后续视觉优化以此组合为准。

## 2026-09-13 用户授权的双方案探索

本次用户明确要求同时交付原有风格精修和全新设计参考方向，并授权自主选择。A 延续现有中性色；B 采用灰紫底、白卡、深色重点区与少量青柠动作强调，重构首页与工作台。这是两套本地候选方案，未自动替换线上批准基准。此最新要求允许本次方案 B 超出下文旧黑白限定；业务字段、组织授权、版本发布和审计规则不因此改变。发布与详情以同一字段结构保持一致，专业字段按用户任务分组。详见 [本轮报告](17-EXPERIENCE-DESIGN-REVIEW-2026-09-13.md)。

## 2026-09-12 统一封面上传

设计资产和 AI 工具的创建、编辑均支持可选封面。共用拖拽/点击选图组件，横向预览、文件名称和大小、取消选择、上传反馈与移除操作；支持 PNG/JPG/WebP，最大 5 MB。无封面统一灰色占位，保持版本发布和图片权限校验。API 64 项测试和前端生产构建通过，上传组件 Lint 通过。

## 2026-09-12 工作台去装饰化

移除英文眉题、宣传性标题与介绍、旧版验证状态、无维护入口的验证状态筛选、重复卡片标签、Beta 与内部运行口径文案。工作台以功能标题和内容为主，保留用户内容标题和摘要、项目真实阶段、草稿/发布及账号启停等操作状态、必要表单说明、错误提示与操作反馈。不修改用户内容和权限。

## 2026-09-12 最新决定：提交即发布（替代下文旧审核流程）

取消内容审核及独立发布审批，移除审核中心、审核角色、审核权限、审核待办和审核统计。具备内容编辑权限的作者或管理员可以保存草稿并提交发布；服务端完整度校验通过后，在同一事务中发布版本、详情与分类标签，立即进入原有可见范围内的目录。登录、组织隔离、内容归属及其他管理权限保持有效。

已有审核中、退回或待发布版本恢复为可编辑草稿，由作者决定何时发布，不自动公开历史内容。历史审核及审计表保留用于数据追溯，不提供审核操作或提醒。旧审核人角色移除，原角色用户按原范围转换为普通成员。AI 输出的人工复核说明属于内容字段，不是平台审批流程。

# PalmPay体验设计Hub — Approved Design Decisions

This file records **final approved decisions**.

Historical chat discussions, temporary variants and abandoned visual experiments do not override this file.

## 1. Overall visual direction

- Use a restrained black-and-white visual system.
- Do not use green as the primary brand color.
- Default theme is dark mode.
- Support light mode.
- The platform should feel professional, calm, precise and suitable for a senior experience-design leadership audience.
- Avoid colorful generic SaaS dashboard aesthetics.
- Avoid excessive gradients, decorative glow and visual noise.
- Avoid page layouts that look like a traditional corporate marketing website.

## 2. Product tone

The platform is not a portfolio.

Approved positioning expression:

> 平台不是作品集，而是治理机制

At normal desktop width, this sentence should remain on one line when space allows.  
Only wrap when the available width is truly insufficient.

## 3. Brand and logo

- Use the approved elliptical outline logo style.
- Do not replace it with the abandoned circular logo direction.
- The logo inside the ellipse should be visually smaller and more refined than early versions.
- Apply the same logo-scale rule consistently across navigation, footer and other logo placements.
- Do not arbitrarily enlarge the logo.

## 4. Theme

- Default: dark mode.
- Light mode is optional but fully supported.
- Dark mode is the primary visual reference.
- Theme tokens must be centralized.
- Do not implement separate unrelated dark and light component styles.

## 5. Typography

- English font direction: Inter Tight.
- Chinese text uses appropriate system fallback.
- UI controls should use compact typography.
- Buttons, Inputs, Tags, Selects and navigation text should not use oversized SaaS dashboard typography.
- Prefer smaller UI text with appropriate component density over large text inside oversized controls.
- Headline hierarchy should remain clear and confident.
- Avoid excessive bold weights across all text.

## 6. UI density

Approved direction:

> Compact, precise, high-information-density workspace.

Rules:

- Buttons should not be unnecessarily tall.
- Inputs should not be unnecessarily tall.
- Selects should match the compact control system.
- Tags should be visually light and compact.
- Navigation spacing should be controlled.
- Cards should not be excessively narrow.
- Card spacing should adapt to the viewport.
- Avoid large empty gaps that reduce scanning efficiency.

## 7. Home page

Approved requirements:

- Keep the dual-entry product structure: public-facing home + internal workspace.
- Public home explains platform value and provides task-oriented entry points.
- Core task-oriented entrances include:
  - 找设计资产
  - 用 AI Skill
  - 看业务影响
- The statement “平台不是作品集，而是治理机制” should stay on one line at normal desktop width when possible.
- The expression “让设计资产被复用 让设计价值被衡量” uses white text in the approved dark visual direction.
- Keep the page readable and suitable for leadership presentation.
- Do not turn the page into a decorative campaign landing page.

## 8. Workspace

Approved primary navigation modules:

- 工作台
- 价值总览
- 设计资产
- AI Skill
- AI 项目库
- AI 案例
- 提交内容
- 审核中心
- 数据洞察
- 管理中心

Workspace rules:

- Maintain a compact professional density.
- Navigation text should not feel oversized.
- Controls should align to one consistent size system.
- The workspace should prioritize scanning and task completion.
- Avoid oversized cards and excessive vertical whitespace.

## 9. Terminology

Final wording:

- 汇报模式 → 演示模式
- 退出汇报模式 → 退出演示模式

Do not restore the previous wording unless explicitly requested.

## 10. AI 项目库

- AI 项目库 remains an independent first-class module.
- Do not merge AI 项目库 into AI Skill.
- AI 项目库 represents exploration directions, opportunity portfolio and pilot candidates.
- It is not a full project-management system.
- Keep project-domain, target-value and stage filtering.
- Project cards and detail pages should preserve a clear exploration / evaluation mental model.

## 11. 设计资产

- Asset detail must help the user decide whether the asset applies to the current task.
- Clearly show:
  - what it is
  - what problem it solves
  - applicable scenarios
  - unsuitable scenarios
  - how to use it
  - current version
  - owner
  - updated time
  - related assets
- Do not reduce asset detail to a title and download button.

## 12. AI Skill

- A Skill is a reusable AI work method, not merely a Prompt text box.
- Skill detail should expose:
  - goal
  - applicable scenarios
  - input requirements
  - output structure
  - Prompt
  - execution steps
  - human review rules
  - limitations
  - examples
  - version
  - owner
- The “新增 Skill” action must have a complete interaction path.
- Do not create a decorative button with no follow-through.

## 13. AI 案例

AI case presentation must answer:

- What was the original problem?
- Where did AI intervene?
- What did AI do?
- What judgment remained with the designer?
- What changed?
- How was it validated?
- What are the limits?
- Can others reuse the method?

Do not present AI cases only as success marketing.

## 14. Asset creation and Skill creation

Approved interaction principle:

- Primary action buttons must have a working end-to-end path.
- “新增资产” must open a valid creation flow.
- “新增 Skill” must open a valid creation flow.
- Do not leave primary action buttons inert.
- Formal V1.0 flows use backend persistence.

## 15. Search

- Search inputs include a clear search icon.
- Search should feel like a core work action, not a decorative filter.
- Search and filtering should respond quickly.
- No-result state must be useful.
- Search state should not visually overwhelm the content list.

## 16. Cards

- Card width should use available space intelligently.
- Avoid overly narrow cards that cause unnecessary title wrapping.
- Avoid huge gaps between cards.
- Important card-level actions must be discoverable.
- The AI project collection card action “打开 +” should not be visually tiny.

## 17. Presentation mode

- Final name: 演示模式.
- It is used for leadership or structured presentation.
- It should hide unnecessary operational noise when appropriate.
- It must not expose sensitive personal or internal data.
- It is not a second disconnected product.

## 18. AI collaboration UI constraint

For the GPT collaboration workflow around this project:

- Do not embed large HTML previews or auto-load heavy code previews in chat.
- Prefer plain-text completion reporting.
- Only generate deployment packages when explicitly requested.
- For PalmPay code modifications, use the latest clean code baseline as the only code baseline.
- Do not reintroduce older code versions.

## 19. Approved v9-1 code baseline (2026-07-16)

- The deployed website at `https://lomi2026.github.io/palmpay-design-intelligence/` is the sole approved v9-1 legacy code baseline.
- Its public home, workspace and all module pages define the approved visual system, layout, information architecture and validated interactions.
- The current V1 placeholder pages do not establish a replacement visual direction.
- V1 must migrate the deployed v9-1 experience into the formal Next.js application while replacing static/localStorage-only implementation with the approved backend and database architecture.
- Do not treat an incomplete local legacy snapshot as a reason to redesign, omit or simplify a deployed v9-1 page.

## 20. Mandatory v9-1 visual parity gate (2026-07-16)

- The deployed v9-1 pages are not only a loose reference: every V1 page that has a v9-1 counterpart must restore the same approved layout, visual hierarchy, information density, wording, interaction behavior and responsive presentation before it is accepted.
- Formal Next.js, API, authentication, RBAC, PostgreSQL, versioning and review implementations must sit behind that approved experience; they must not introduce a substitute visual direction or simplified placeholder page.
- No Phase 4 feature work may begin until the v9-1 counterpart pages have been inspected side by side and their visual/interaction parity is verified with screenshots.
- New formal-only pages such as notifications and personal submissions must inherit the v9-1 workspace shell, density and component language. They cannot redefine the system style.

## 21. Delivery order override (2026-07-17)

- By explicit user decision, complete formal Phase 4 and Phase 5 capabilities before resuming the final v9-1 visual-parity remediation.
- The deployed v9-1 visual and interaction baseline remains mandatory for final acceptance and launch; this decision changes delivery order only.

## 22. Decision change process

When a new explicit user decision changes this file:

1. Update this file.
2. Record the new final decision.
3. Remove or clearly mark the replaced decision.
4. Update implementation if needed.
5. Do not keep two conflicting active rules.

## 23. shadcn/ui implementation constraint (2026-07-16)

- All formal V1 UI primitives must follow shadcn/ui component conventions, accessibility behavior and token-driven styling.
- Do not invent replacement Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Tabs, Sheet, Card, Badge, Toast or navigation primitives when an appropriate shadcn/ui component exists.
- v9-1 visual parity must be achieved through approved composition, theme tokens, spacing and variants; do not fork or arbitrarily alter shadcn/ui component behavior to imitate the legacy static implementation.
- Any required component extension must preserve the upstream shadcn/ui API and accessibility contract, be isolated as an explicit variant, and be documented before use.

## 24. Functional interface completion before final pixel parity (2026-07-17)

- By explicit user decision, pause the remaining pixel-level v9-1 remediation and complete the formal workspace functional interface first.
- Add a Phase 5.5 functional-interface completion pass before Phase 6 acceptance.

## 25. Functional closure, desktop parity, then mobile adaptation (2026-07-18)

- The functional-interface pass must be judged by an explicit P0 workflow audit and deployed browser evidence, not merely by the existence of routes or server actions.
- The current delivery order is: complete and verify desktop functional workflows first; restore desktop Web v9-1 parity second; perform mobile adaptation last.
- Do not spend implementation capacity on pixel-level polish or mobile-specific parity while an identified P0 action, validation rule, attachment path or role workflow remains incomplete.
- The existing workspace navigation-performance defect is tracked separately and is not represented as accepted merely because a code change was deployed.

## 26. Superseded continuous v9-1 parity remediation (2026-07-18)

This previous delivery order is superseded by Decision 25. It remains as historical context only; functional closure is now the active priority.

- By explicit user decision, resume and complete the final v9-1 visual and interaction parity work for every page that has a deployed v9-1 counterpart.
- Work through the approved priority order without waiting for further confirmation between individual page or flow batches: public entry, workspace shell and overview, knowledge catalogs and details, contribution/review flows, then formal-only pages inheriting the same system.
- Every parity change must preserve the formal V1 API, PostgreSQL, RBAC, versioning, review and audit behavior already implemented. Static prototype behavior and localStorage must not be reintroduced as a substitute.
- Completion still requires applicable automated checks and source-versus-rendered visual evidence at desktop and mobile breakpoints. A page without that evidence remains open in the parity inventory.
- Phase 5.5 must expose the implemented modules through a complete permission-aware desktop and mobile navigation system, remove inert controls, bind the workspace dashboard to formal APIs, and complete the missing personal, governance, analytics and administration surfaces.
- RBAC remains authoritative: a menu item may be absent for a user who does not have its permission, and no visual completion work may bypass API or page authorization.
- Final v9-1 parity remains a launch gate after functional-interface and critical-flow completion.

## 27. Workspace first-entry loading state (2026-08-01)

- By explicit user decision, the first entry to a Workspace menu page uses the earliest approved full skeleton pattern: heading lines, four summary-card placeholders and one main-content placeholder.
- Do not replace this pattern with the top progress strip and loading text.
- This decision changes loading presentation only. Route boundaries, caching, prefetch, permissions and data-fetching behavior remain unchanged.

## 28. Chinese-first interface wording (2026-08-02)

- By explicit user decision, user-facing field labels, actions, status explanations and operational copy use Chinese across the public home and formal workspace.
- Main Workspace menu pages retain a short uppercase English eyebrow as visual decoration above the primary Chinese heading. This exception does not apply to operational fields, buttons, filters, permissions, statuses or explanations, which remain Chinese-first.
- Approved brand names, project codes, version notation and established product terms such as PalmPay Design, AI Skill, Prompt, Beta 1.0 and v9-1 remain unchanged unless a later explicit decision replaces them.
- Machine identifiers and third-party technology names may remain in their canonical form when translation would reduce traceability or accuracy. Permission codes remain internal identifiers, while the management interface displays their Chinese permission names.

## 29. Test-environment passwordless login (2026-08-30)

- By explicit user decision, the external acceptance environment no longer asks users for the shared test access code.
- Test users sign in with the email address of a pre-provisioned active account. The backend must still resolve that account before issuing a short-lived signed session and must retain all RBAC and disabled-user checks.
- The login page should start warming the sleeping test API when opened, explain that the first connection may take about one minute, and expose a clear pending state while login is running.
- This decision applies only to the isolated acceptance environment. Formal production authentication still requires enterprise OIDC/SSO and must not reuse the passwordless test adapter.

## 30. Dark-mode visual comfort baseline (2026-08-31)

- By explicit user decision, the full platform dark theme must reduce long-session eye strain while preserving the approved restrained black-and-white direction, compact density and information architecture.
- Dark mode uses one centralized semantic palette across the public home, Workspace shell, catalogs, details, contribution flows, governance, analytics, administration and shadcn portals.
- Approved dark foundations:
  - page background `#121416`
  - sidebar `#0F1113`
  - primary surface `#15181B`
  - card surface `#181B1F`
  - raised / field surface `#20242A`
  - hover / accent surface `#282D34`
  - primary text `#E1E5E9`
  - secondary text `#B2B8C0`
  - supporting copy `#A5ACB5`
  - metadata `#9099A5`
- Near-pure black page backgrounds and near-pure white non-interactive headings are no longer the dark-mode baseline. High-contrast light surfaces remain reserved for compact primary actions, not large information cards.
- Large inverse white governance or analytics cards must use the shared dark surface hierarchy in dark mode to avoid abrupt luminance jumps. Light mode remains fully supported through the same semantic variables.
- Decorative grids and glows must remain quieter than content. They use centralized grid/glow tokens and cannot rely on page-specific 10% white lines.

## 31. Personal navigation consolidation (2026-09-12)

- By explicit user decision, merge favorites and recent views into one header icon entry named「收藏与浏览」to the left of the theme toggle, matching its button styling and removing the sidebar entry, using the existing shadcn Tabs with「我的收藏」selected by default and「最近浏览」as the second tab.
- Both tabs use `/workspace/favorites`; recent views use `?tab=recent`. Preserve old `/workspace/recent` links by redirecting to that tab and retain recent-view freshness on re-entry. Load only the selected tab dataset.
- Remove notification center from desktop and mobile menus. The top-right bell opens the existing protected notification route as a secondary page with a Workspace breadcrumb and return link. Preserve notification read/unread behavior.

- Navigation order update (2026-09-12):「知识与能力」appears above「个人空间」in the shared desktop/mobile navigation; item order within each group stays unchanged.

- By explicit user decision,「我的贡献」is the single navigation entry for「我的内容 / 提交记录」tabs. Preserve permission checks for content creation and submission independently, load only the active panel, and redirect `/workspace/submissions` to `/workspace/contributions?tab=submissions`.

## 32. AI tools directory entry (2026-09-12)

- By explicit user request, add「AI 工具」after「AI 案例」in the knowledge navigation, at `/workspace/ai-tools`. Match the Design Assets heading, spacing, search/filter bar and grid/list view controls, with shared light/dark tokens.
- Superseding the initial empty shell, the user approved AI tools in the formal submission workflow. Use a fifth independent AI_TOOL content type with dedicated fields, real permission-filtered published records, and create/detail/edit actions. Preserve the shared review and publication boundary.

## 33. Compact account menu (2026-09-12)

- The Workspace header shows only the circular PA account trigger. Hover or click opens a Radix dropdown containing the current user name, authenticated email, role, login/switch-account link and existing logout action. Preserve keyboard navigation, Escape/outside dismissal, and a short pointer grace period between trigger and menu.

## 2026-09-16 管理表单与控件

用户管理右上角以“添加用户”替代用户数量标签，新增字段通过弹窗展示。用户行姓名、状态及停用时内容转移统一点击“保存”后生效；后台合并事务，失败时不部分保存。标准输入框、选择器与 default/sm 操作按钮统一 40px，管理中心同类编辑控件顶部对齐、间距 12px；保留独立图标按钮与特殊尺寸变体。

## 2026-09-16 按钮按场景分级（替代一律 40px）

用户确认：主操作 40px、页面辅助操作 36px、卡片/列表及分类筛选 32px；按钮采用 12px 圆角，管理导航 Tab 保持 40px 高、8px 圆角。顶部图标入口 40px，局部图标入口 32px。同组弹窗确认/取消、与输入框或选择器并排的操作保持 40px，管理编辑行间距 12px。新增、保存和发布可配语义图标；发布页仅突出发布，保存草稿使用次级样式。

## 2026-09-16 统一组件交互状态

公共输入框、文本域、选择器、按钮、Tab、勾选控件共享状态规范，集中在 component-states.css，覆盖页面旧样式和弹窗。悬浮、按下、选中、键盘焦点、无效值、只读、禁用分别呈现；无效值优先于普通悬浮，禁用优先于其他状态。选择器转发 aria-invalid；保留原有业务校验和错误提示。亮暗主题使用语义色，不改变已确认尺寸与卡片位移动效。

## 2026-09-16 圆角归一

按用户要求，将正式前端的组件圆角统一为 8/12/16/24px 四档，所有交互状态保持原组件圆角。详见 docs/07-COMPONENT-RADIUS.md。此规范替代前文不一致的局部圆角数值，保留圆形状态元素及进度条等形状例外。

## 2026-09-16 菜单加载反馈首版

工作台、价值总览、数据洞察增加路由级加载占位；不以 0 冒充未加载统计。菜单待导航时显示轻量状态，数据到达后内容 240ms 淡入、数字 400ms 过渡。同一浏览器页面会话内重复访问不重播，减少动态效果时直接呈现；保留真实数据 no-store 与所有权限检查。关闭三页普通链接自动预取，减少后台请求。当前统计仍使用各页现有聚合接口，本版没有拆成逐卡独立请求。

## 2026-09-16 加载动效调整（替代首版加载占位）

按用户最新要求，移除菜单加载图标及三页 loading 占位，导航等待期间保留当前内容。数字改为 1000ms 匀速整数递增，避免小数字在缓出曲线下过早抵达目标；保留重复访问不重播、减少动态效果和最终值准确性。本地预览更新，未发布。

## 2026-09-16 筛选栏白底与项目间距

浅色模式下，五类目录及我的贡献筛选输入和选择器使用白底，沿用深色及禁用等状态规则。项目库筛选栏到项目探索组合标题间距 24px，标题到统计卡片间距 12px。
