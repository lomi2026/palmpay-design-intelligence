# PalmPay体验设计Hub — Current Project Status

Last Updated: 2026-07-16

## Current Phase

**Phase 2 content catalog foundation — core catalogs verified**

## Current Objective

Complete the remaining Phase 2 content-catalog boundary after the core catalogs have been verified.

The next engineering objective is:

> Confirm an object-storage provider and implement real attachment acceptance without weakening the formal content, permission or version model.

## Approved Product Baseline

- The deployed final v9-1 website at `https://lomi2026.github.io/palmpay-design-intelligence/` is the only approved legacy code baseline.
- Older v5, v6, v8 and v9 variants are not implementation baselines.
- The deployed v9-1 public home, workspace and module pages are the approved visual, information architecture and interaction reference.
- `legacy/v9-1/` is an archival local snapshot and cannot override or narrow the deployed baseline when it is incomplete.
- v9-1 is not the production architecture.

## Completed

- v9-1 high-fidelity interaction prototype
- Public home and internal workspace product structure
- Core product positioning
- V1.0 product reconstruction blueprint
- V1.0 PRD
- Database ER model
- Frontend / backend development plan
- Design decision consolidation
- AI collaboration rules
- Codex `AGENTS.md`
- Claude `CLAUDE.md`
- pnpm workspace with formal Next.js Web and NestJS API projects
- PostgreSQL 17 development database and applied Prisma initial migration
- Organization, Team, User, Role, Permission and UserRole persistence and APIs
- Seeded system roles, role-permission matrix and default taxonomy
- Isolated development authentication adapter and current-user API
- Backend RBAC, organization isolation and disabled-user enforcement
- Frontend development login, current-user loading, protected workspace and logout
- Lint, strict type checking, integration tests and production builds
- Unified Content / ContentVersion and four content-type detail models
- Tags, file metadata, attachment relations and content relations
- Applied Phase 2 content catalog migration
- Permission-filtered published-content list and detail APIs
- Formal design-asset list, search, empty state and detail pages
- Audited deployed v9-1 source commit `bf39748` and created an idempotent AI-project migration script
- Imported 33 v9-1 AI projects (P01–P26 and S01–S07) into PostgreSQL with formal versions, categories, tags, source traceability and organization-safe visibility
- Created the `PalmPay Experience Design` umbrella team; all imported projects are initially owned by `lomi2026@126.com` per the explicit migration decision
- Formal AI project catalog list and detail pages backed by the permission-filtered API, with v9-1 project-library visual and information hierarchy
- Imported 6 v9-1 AI Skills and 4 v9-1 AI cases into PostgreSQL, retaining source traceability and their original verification states
- Formal AI Skill and AI case catalog list/detail pages backed by the permission-filtered API, using the deployed v9-1 information hierarchy

## Known Legacy Limitations

- Static or compiled frontend structure
- Business data embedded in frontend
- localStorage used for part of user / favorite / submission / review simulation
- Simulated roles
- No formal enterprise authentication
- No formal PostgreSQL business database
- No real file storage
- No durable review history
- No formal audit log
- Analytics contains demo-oriented logic
- AI Skill mainly supports viewing and Prompt copy
- AI projects are exploration content, not formal pilot workflow

## In Progress

- Confirm an object-storage provider and implement the formal attachment upload boundary; do not claim attachment acceptance before this is available

## Next Task

Codex should:

1. Confirm an object-storage provider before implementing or claiming real attachment acceptance.
2. Add catalog-level filtering and pagination once real content volume requires it.
3. Keep draft creation, autosave and version-history workflows in Phase 3.

## Next Milestone

**Phase 2 content catalog foundation**

Milestone definition:

- Four content types and their formal detail records can be persisted in PostgreSQL.
- Published catalog lists and details load from permission-filtered APIs.
- Category and tag relationships use formal entities.
- File metadata uses an explicit storage adapter boundary; localStorage is not used.
- Type check, lint, relevant integration tests and production build pass.

## Not Started

- Formal content center core catalogs (verified; real attachments remain)
- Content version workflow
- Review workflow
- Real file storage
- Full search
- Favorites persistence
- Usage confirmation
- Analytics event pipeline
- Value overview with real data
- Admin center
- Audit log
- AI Gateway
- Online AI Skill execution
- Figma integration
- Yuque integration
- Jira integration
- GitHub integration

## Current Blockers / Decisions Needed

The following decisions may affect later implementation:

- Enterprise SSO / OIDC provider is not yet confirmed.
- Production hosting and database provider are not yet confirmed.
- Object storage provider is not yet confirmed.
- Legacy examples contain team labels but no formal owner-user identity mapping required by the V1.0 ER model.
- The ER defines `restricted` visibility but does not define a user/group ACL entity; current catalog access is limited to the owner or `content.edit_all` users.
- The local development PostgreSQL instance is extracted under `/private/tmp` and is not a persistent system service.
- AI input data policy and approved external model boundary are not yet confirmed.
- Single-reviewer or multi-reviewer formal publishing policy is not yet confirmed.

These unresolved items must not block repository setup, initial data model, RBAC base or an authentication adapter boundary.
